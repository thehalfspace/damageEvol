### Earthquake Cycles with Low-Velocity Fault Damage Zone: Evolution of damage during seismic and interseismic periods.

Following the arguments of seismic observations of elastic wave velocity changes in the damage zone (e.g., Li et al., 2001; Vidale and Li, 2006, etc), we are trying to model the interseismic healing and seismic damage as changes in an elastic low-velocity layer surrounding vertical strike-slip faults.
